     <p>Unlike other vehicles, cars are supposed to be on land <strong>ONLY</strong>. Planes have wheels, but that is because it's used for landing so the plane doesn't crash. </p>

     <p>Hey, the parts of a car are very important, as if you want to be a engineer, you've got to know the parts of a car. </p>

            <td>The chassis of an automobile has the frame, suspension system, axles, and wheel as the main components. The frame could be in the form of a conventional chassis or unit construction may be adopted.
            In a conventional chassis frame, the frame forms the main skeleton of the vehicle. The frame provides a foundation for the engine and the body of the vehicle. The frame is constructed from square or box-shaped steel members strong enough to support the weight of the body and other components.
            The automobile frame is usually made up of a number of members welded or riveted together to give the final shape. The engine is mounted on the frame with rubber pads which absorb vibrations and also provide damping of these vibrations. Absorption and damping of vibrations protect passengers from discomfort caused by shocks.
            The frame is supported on wheel axles by means of springs. This whole assembly is called the chassis.</td>
            <td>The engine is a power generator/power plant or a motor, which provides power to drive the automobile.
            The engine is the heart of your car. It is a complex machine built to convert heat from burning gas into the force that turns the road wheels. It consists of two basic parts: the lower, heavier section is the cylinder block, a casing for the engines main moving parts; the detachable upper cover is the cylinder head.
            In most automobile engines, the explosive power of the mixture of air and gasoline drives the pistons. The pistons turn a crankshaft to which they are attached. The rotating force of the crankshaft makes the automobiles wheels turn.
            Some automobiles are powered by another kind of engine, known as the rotary valve, rotating combustion engine, or Wankel engine. The rotary valve engine also draws in a mixture of air and fuel, which is then compressed and burnt.
            A motor revolving in an elliptical chamber is connected to a shaft, which finally drives the rear wheels. In most automobiles, the engine is mounted at the front end of the car, with the clutch and gearbox immediately behind it; the engine, clutch, and gearbox are assembled into a single unit.
            A number of systems are necessary to make an engine work. A lubrication system is needed to reduce friction and prevent engine wear. A cooling system is required to keep the engines temperature within safe limits. The engine must be provided with the correct amount of air and fuel by a fuel system.
            The mixture of air and fuel must be ignited inside the cylinder at just the right time by an ignition system. Finally, an electrical system is required to operate the cranking motor that starts the engine and to provide electrical energy to power engine accessories.</td>
            <td>The main function of the transmission is to provide the necessary variation to the torque applied by the engine to the wheels. This is achieved by changing the gearing ratio between the engine output shaft and the drive shaft.
            A car transmission is a vehicles gearbox. Its roughly analogous to the gear shifter and chain system that bicycles use.
            These components are always mounted straight on the engine so that their attached belt and gear system can effectively convert the combustion power produced by the engine into physical momentum.
             A transmission changes gears depending on car speed and accelerator input (i.e., how far down you push the pedal of your car) so that the engines RPM or “revolutions per minute” are kept appropriately low. 
            This provides two benefits: Fuel consumption is decreased, and The turning gears do not overload your engine.</td>
            <td>The main purpose of the bodywork is to provide accommodation for the driver and passengers, with suitable protection against wind and weather. The degree of comfort provided depends upon the type of car and its cost.
            The body on the first automobiles was little more than a platform with seats attached. It gradually developed into a closed compartment complete with a roof and windows. The modern automobile body is constructed of sheet steel formed to the required shape in giant punch presses.
            Most of the body components are welded together to form a light rattle-free unit. Automobiles may also be classed on the basis of their body style.</td>
            <td>The steering system is used for changing the direction of the vehicle. The major requirements in any steering mechanism are that it should be precise and easy to handle and that the front wheels should have a tendency to return to the straight-ahead position after a turn.
            A gear mechanism, which is known as steering gear, is used in this system to increase the steering effort provided by the driver. This system makes the car steering very easy as the driver does not have to put in much effort.
            Car steering is not only required on a curved road but also while maneuvering on busy traffic roads. The steering system allows the vehicle to be guided, i.e., to be turned left or right.
            Modern steering wheels also often have accessory functions built-in, such as cruise control, audio system selection, and volume. Some steering wheels are even electrically heated.</td>
            <td>An engine has many moving parts which eventually develop wear, as they move against each other. The engine circulates oil between these moving parts to prevent the metal-to-metal contact that results in wear. Parts that are oiled can move more easily with less friction and hence power loss due to friction is minimized.
            The secondary function of a lubricant is to act as a coolant and also as a sealing medium to prevent leakages. Finally, a film of lubricant on the cylinder walls helps the rings in sealing and thus improves the enginess compressions.</td>
            <td>Due to the combustion of fuel with air inside the cylinder, the temperature of the engine parts increases. This increase in temperature directly affects the engine performance and the life of the engine parts.
            The cooling system keeps the engine operating at an efficient temperature. Whatever the driving conditions, the system is designed to prevent both overheating and overcooling.</td>
            <td>The purpose of the ignition system is to provide assistance for the combustion of fuel either by a high voltage spark or self-ignition in each of the engines cylinders at the right time so that the air-fuel mixture can burn completely.
            The fuel supplied to the combustion chamber must be ignited to deliver power. In a spark-ignition engine, an electric spark is used for this purpose. The compression-ignition engine does not require a separate ignition system because the ignition is affected by the compression of the mixture to high pressure.</td>
            <td>The engines electrical system provides energy to operate a starting motor and to power all the accessories. The main components of the electrical system are a battery, an alternator, a starting motor, an ignition coil, and a heater.</td>
            <td>Your car battery provides the zap of electricity needed to put electrical components to work. Talk about a pretty huge responsibility. Without battery power, your car, as youve probably noticed, wont start.</td>

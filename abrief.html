    <h1>A Brief History of Cars</h1>
    <p id="text">
        The first working steam-powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest.
        It was a 65-centimetre (26 in)-long scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.
        Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, another inventor, is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car; he created a steam-powered tricycle.
        In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was 
        unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use. The development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the history 
        of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars.In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouv√© demonstrated the first working (three-wheeled) car powered
         by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris.Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were 
         working on the problem at about the same time, the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally 
         acknowledged as the inventor of the car.
